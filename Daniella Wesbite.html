    <h2><b>My Family</b></h2>
	<img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/IMG_5885.jpg?raw=true" alt="My family (excluding my oldest brother) at a wedding" width = "504" height = "378" class="aligncenter">
    
    <h3>Parents</h3>
     <!--Be sure to put a picture of mom, dad, or the brothers-->
      <right>
	
	<p style="font-family:courier;">My mom, Angela, and my dad, Adib, have been married for <br> more 
	   than 25 years. Actually, a fun fact about my <br> parents is that they were married on 9/11, but
	   it was a <br> few years before the tragic event occurred.</p>

    <h3>Brothers</h3>
      <p style="font-family:courier;">I have two brothers. Daniel is two years older than me <br> and
         Dominic is six years older than me. Daniel is <br> currently in college. I have tons in common with
         Dominic, <br> who is a real estate agent. As my mom says everyday, <br> "You guys are
         twins six years apart." She's not wrong.<br>
         <br>

    <h3>Me</h3>
      <p style="font-family:courier;">I was born in San Deigo, but my family is originally <br> from the Middle East, specifically Northern Iraq.
         My <br> family is considered Chaldean, which is like the <br> original people that used to live in Babylon during
         the <br> birth of Jesus. We speak Aramaic and Arabic at home, <br> but I'm not very fluent. I like
         to cook in my spare <br> time. Foreign food interests me the most since I can <br> learn about other people's
         though delicious cuisine. My <br> dream home is will be somehwere that never snows and is <br> always warm. It would probably look something like the <br> image.<br>

      <br>
    <h3>My Favorite Music</h3>
	<p style="font-family:courier;">I like a variety of music and can listen to almost <br> anything. Rock, pop, epicore, classical music, country <br>
					and even songs in other languages. A few I don't like is <br> jazz and indie music. If they aren't good at singing, <br>
					I'm not gonna like them.
