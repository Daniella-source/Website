    <h1>This is my Portfolio Page!</h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/Project-9-20-2024.png?raw=true" alt="Project in bubble font" height="250">
      <br>
    <h1>   Project #1: Build A Snowman</h1>
        <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/Snowman%20Project.PNG?raw=true" alt = "Picture of Final Product of Snowman Project" height = "250">
      <br>
	    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">This snowman program allows users to build their snowman however they want. They may add features and accessories to the snowman or not build one.</p>
    <h1>   Project #2: Nimble Knights</h1>
        <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/Nimble%20Knights.PNG?raw=true" alt = "Picture of little knights that are attacking other knights in a video game style." height="250">
      </a>
      <be>
	    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">This program allows users to control a knight and attack other players (which are programmed to be easy). Once the player has died, they can see their score and place on the leaderboard.</p>
    <h1>   Project #3: Make an E-Card Invite for Halloween Event</h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/finalfinalproduct'.PNG?raw=true" alt = "A card with writing inviting someone to a Halloween Boo Bash party." height="250">
      <br>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">When the user runs this program, they can put down who the card is to and who it is from. Then, they can either choose to make their own custom message or use the premade message for the card. There is even a little cute interaction with a pumpkin and a ghost before they get to the card.</p>
    <h1>   Project #4: Fixing the Fish Tank.</h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/fish%20tank%20moniter.PNG?raw=true" alt = "The image of the fish tank giving the status of the fish tank and what needs to be adjusted." height="300">
	<img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/fish%20tank%20status.PNG?raw=true" alt = "The status of the fish tank." height="300">
	     <p style = "font-size: 20px;">We fixed the code for the magnesium, alkalinity, and temperature checkers, so now it says when it is too low or too high.</p>

    <h1>   Project #5: Island Escape.</h1>
	<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1096118598/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">In this game, the player has to escape an island by collecting resources to build a boat. Once the boat is built, players can see the boat they have unrealistically created.</p>

    <h1>   Project #6: GUI Interface.</h1>
       <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/GUI%20image.PNG?raw=true" alt = "The GUI window appears and shows functions such as save, look up, trace, and ping." height="300">
	      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">This window allows users to enter a URL and has a variety of options to work with. The user can ping, trace, and look up whether the website is still running. There is also a save function that allows users to download the results to their computer/device.</p>
	      <br>
   <h1>   Project #7: Rover In An Unknown Location</h1>
	  <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/graph.PNG?raw=true" alt = "The graphs show data of the temperature, gyroscope, light, and sound of the unknown area that the rover is traveling in." height="300">
	  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daniella-source/Website/refs/heads/main/marshlands.avif" alt = "An image of the marsh lands that my group believes the rover is located." height="300">
	      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">We believe that the rover is located in the marsh lands because it was decribed to have smooth constant temperatures throughout the day, constant chittering, low ambient light, and little to no wind. All of this is shown in the graphs because the temperature does not change a lot and there is constant volme at a certain point, meaning there are animals chittering constantly. The gyroscope also shows little angular differnces from the wind, so that means the wind is not very strong. The light also stays very low during the daytime and increases at night, just like the marsh lands.

 <h1>   Project #8: Honey Production of Bees in the U.S.</h1>
	 <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/graph%201.PNG?raw=true" alt = "A graph of states that are large producers and how much honey is produced." height="300">
	 <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/graph%202.PNG?raw=true" alt = "A graph of states that are mid producers and how much honey is produced." height="300">
	 <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/graph%203.PNG?raw=true" alt = "A graph of states that are small producers and how much honey is produced." height="300">
	 <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/bee.jpg?raw=true" alt = "A bee that is pollinating a flower." height="300">
	      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">The production of honey has been increasing over the past few years, but it was not like that in 1997. There were less operational facilities and less bees to produce the honey, but now they are increasing, and with more bees living outside of human captivity.</p>
