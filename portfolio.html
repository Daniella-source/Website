    <h1>This is my Portfolio Page!</h1>

    <h1>   Project #1: Build A Snowman</h1>
        <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/Snowman%20Project.PNG?raw=true" alt = "Picture of Final Product of Snowman Project" height = "250">
      <br>
	    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">This snowman program allows users to build their snowman however they want. They may add features and accessories to the snowman or not build one.</p>
    <h1>   Project #2: Nimble Knights</h1>
        <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/Nimble%20Knights.PNG?raw=true" alt = "Picture of little knights that are attacking other knights in a video game style." height="250">
      </a>
      <be>
	    <p style = "font-size: 20px;">This program allows users to control a knight and attack other players (which are programmed to be easy). Once the player has died, they can see their score and place on the leaderboard.</p>
    <h1>   Project #3: Make an E-Card Invite for Halloween Event</h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/finalfinalproduct'.PNG?raw=true" alt = "A card with writing inviting someone to a Halloween Boo Bash party." height="250">
      <br>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">When the user runs this program, they can put down who the card is to and who it is from. Then, they can either choose to make their own custom message or use the premade message for the card. There is even a little cute interaction with a pumpkin and a ghost before they get to the card.</p>
    <h1>   Project #4: Fixing the Fish Tank.</h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/fish%20tank%20moniter.PNG?raw=true" alt = "The image of the fish tank giving the status of the fish tank and what needs to be adjusted." height="300">
	<img src="https://github.com/Daniella-source/Website/blob/main/fish%20tank%20status.PNG?raw=true" alt = "The status of the fish tank." height="300">
	     <p style = "font-size: 20px;">We fixed the code for the magnesium, alkilinity, and temperature checkers, so now it says when it is too low or too high.</p>
